## Key Insights

- **Decreased Conversion Rates:** The conversion rate demonstrated a strong rebound in December, reaching 10.2%, despite a notable dip to 5.0% in October.
- While clicks and likes are low compared to views, the click-through rate stands at 15.37%, meaning that engaged users are still interacting effectively.
- **Customer ratings** have remained consistent, averaging around 3.7 throughout the year.
- Although stable, the **average rating** is below the target of 4.0, suggesting a need for focused improvements in customer satisfaction, for products below 3,5.
- Throughout the year, conversion rates varied, with higher numbers of products converting successfully in months like February and July. This suggests that while some products had strong seasonal peaks, there is potential to improve conversions in lower-performing months through targeted interventions.
